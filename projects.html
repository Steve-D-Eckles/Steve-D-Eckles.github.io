          <h2>This Site!</h2>
          <p>This site was created from the ground up using HTML, CSS, blood,
            sweat, and tears. It was not only a chance to apply the skills I gained in
            the first few weeks of the CSET program at Thaddeus Stevens but also a
            sandbox for experimenting with new tools to fit my design.</p>
          <p>This project was version controlled with Git and has a repo
            available for public perusal

          <p><a href="https://steve-d-eckles.github.io/Fragile/" target="_blank">Fragile</a>
            is a browser-based JavaScript puzzle game created by Brian Burchett and
            me as the final project in our first semester of the CSET program.
            It was planned and implemented using the Agile process and a centralized
            Git workflow. We planned requirements, created user stories and assigned
            them points, and had daily standups with our instructor to discuss
            current plans and roadblocks and keep track of our burndown rate.</p>
          <p>There is, of course, a

              Mountain of Madness
            </a>
            is a text-based adventure game written in Python. It served as an
            introduction to Object-Oriented Programming and was based on a framework
            laid out in Zed Shaw's <span class="book">Learn Python the Hard Way</span>.</p>
          <p>Other skills that were practiced in the development of this game
            include splitting a program into modules, following proper naming conventions,
            and improving usage of comments and docstrings.

          <p>Thaddeus Stevens is focused on taking students and forging them
            into job-ready professionals in their chosen field, so a large portion
            of our class time is dedicated to practicing real, valuable skills.</p>
          <p>All of our labs from class are created as Git repositories, and
            they are all available <a href="https://github.com/Steve-D-Eckles/" target="_blank">on GitHub.</a></p>
